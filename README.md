# arctis7_controls
Controls for Steelseries Arctis 7 (2019) wireless headset written in Rust or Python (your choice)

Made this so I don't have to use the Steelseries control engine adware virus.
I find that it makes the quality of the headset worse.

Works on Windows, and most likely on Linux.

**The Rust version is preferred and the one that will be maintained.** The Python one works still though.

## Python Prerequisites
- Python 3
- PyUSB
- libusb or some other backend for PyUSB

## Rust Prerequisites
- Rust + cargo

### Installation using Cargo
```
cargo install arctis7-controls
```
or from source
```
git clone https://github.com/trevarj/arctis7_controls
cd arctis7_controls/rust
cargo install --path .
```

#### Windows 
1. Install [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/)
1. Open it and select `Options->List All Devices`
1. Find `Steelseries Arctis 7 (Interface 5)`
1. Install the WinUSB driver to it

Now you can successfully write to the device without Windows throwing a fit.
